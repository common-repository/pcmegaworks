== Description ==
<p>The PC Megaworks Plugin is a consolidation of commonly used functionality in one plugin. Many plugin makers make one thing and make it well. We aspire to do the same thing by providing simple capabilities in abundance.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of very simple features that are commonly desired, but not already built into a theme. There a litany of one-purpose plugins to remedy this obstacle that each need server time and space. By combining them into one plugin we hope to help optimize load time, and potentially improve site speed.</p>
<h1>
 Critical update 001.037.001 for redirect failure in this release. We advise updating immediately. Thanks @philharmonic for help to replicate the issue and subsequent solution.
</h1>
<p>The time of death by a thousand plugins is over. Our plugin is extensible, and we make it better by adding features you suggest. Here's what we have so far:
<ul>
  <li>Basic Chat capabilities with built in session control and handling for custom pages, or all pages.</li>
  <li>Customizable Google maps with groups to display multiple locations on one map (requires Google account for API keys ), directions ( driving and biking ), zoom level, geographic elevation and custom icons</li>
  <li>Custom form creator with customizable login, registration, contact us, and how are we doing forms as starters.</li>
  <li>Built in help desk in the event something goes wrong, including built in debugging with on/off setting in case of trouble</li>
  <li>Admin groups and users for page and content controls, macro role management</li>
  <li>Custom WordPress login logo, in the event you don't need a custom login page</li>
  <li>Mail blast with edit and storage capability, with user control opt-in and out</li>
  <li>Feature request form built in for convenience</li>
  <li>Http 404 redirects for popular pages that are moved, or for new sites where the URL structure is different. This can also be useful for multiple domain websites</li>
  <li>Ala carte installation for major features to avoid file and database cluttering, with no-trace un-installation and cleanup.</li>
  <li>Broken link finder to locate any pages on your site which have unreachable link destinations</li>
  <li>Missing image finder to locate any images that have been removed, incorrectly named, or are otherwise broken</li>
  <li>Custom registration email and landing page text with macro replacement for links and terms so you can control what your welcome email looks like</li>
  <li>Embedded HTML5 video player with display options and shortcode. This includes access control options and groups delegation to limit media content without limiting page access</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Road Map</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>PC Megatheme is on the way! Our custom theme loaded with options and adjustable settings. ( delayed to focus on implementing improvements )</li>
    <li>Custom form creation instructions and tricks documentation</li>
    <li>Add wp-admin options restriction for roles, so user groups can define hierarchical controls of simple WordPress capability roles</li>
    <li>Create multi-maps capability allowing multiple form groups to exist on a single page</li>
    <li>Implement form conditional logic user interface for increased capabilities in simple form control</li>
    <li>Build WIKI, and helpdesk ticket response interface from WordPress-admin backend to keep up with issues through the WordPress interface opposed to email contact.</li>
    <li>Add custom admin group creation and WordPress role control tie in to allow any WordPress capability a unique control group</li>
    <li>QR and barcode creator</li>
    <li>Internal helpdesk for your site and users</li>
    <li>SMS and IVR messaging tie in with Mercury Messages engine</li>
</ul>
